  - All dependencies pinned in `pyproject.toml`
  - [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for fast, reliable installs
- **Code Quality Automation:**
  - [Ruff](https://pypi.org/project/ruff/) for linting and formatting
  - [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/) for type checking
  - [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) for automated code quality
- **Testing & Coverage:**
  - [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/) for all tests
  - [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) for coverage
- **Security:**
  - [bandit](https://pypi.org/project/bandit/) and [safety](https://pypi.org/project/safety/) integrated in CI
- **Continuous Integration:**
  - GitHub Actions for multi-version testing, linting, type checking, security, and coverage artifact upload
- **Documentation:**
  - Up-to-date `README.md`, best practices, and testing validation docs

---

## üöß In Progress / Next Steps

- Expand test coverage for edge cases and new features
- Add more usage examples and API documentation in `docs/`
- Enhance error handling and logging throughout the pipeline
- Add more advanced image processing presets and batch options
- Improve performance monitoring and metrics
- Add more pre-commit hooks for additional code quality checks

---

## üõ£Ô∏è Future Enhancements

- Containerization (Docker support for deployment)
- Optional web interface for batch processing and monitoring
- Cloud deployment automation (Azure, AWS, or GCP)
- API endpoints for remote processing (Flask/FastAPI)
- Database integration for processing history and analytics
- Automated changelog and release notes generation

---

## How to Contribute

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Install all dependencies: `uv sync --all-extras`
3. Set up pre-commit: `uv run pre-commit install`
4. Use `uv` commands or `Makefile` for all dev tasks
5. Open a PR with your changes and reference the relevant roadmap item

# üöÄ BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP

## üìã **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Week 1)**

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1: Development Environment Setup**
```bash
# 1. Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# 2. Set up pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# 3. Format existing code
black src tests
isort src tests

# 4. Run initial tests
pytest
```

### üîß **Files Created:**
- ‚úÖ `requirements-dev.txt` - Development dependencies
- ‚úÖ `pytest.ini` - Test configuration
- ‚úÖ `setup.cfg` - Code quality tools configuration
- ‚úÖ `Makefile` - Common development tasks
- ‚úÖ `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Git hooks configuration
- ‚úÖ `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ `src/utils/logging_config.py` - Proper logging setup
- ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` - Development artifacts exclusion

## üéØ **NEXT STEPS (Week 2-3)**

### **Priority 1: Testing Framework**
- [ ] Convert existing tests to use pytest
- [ ] Add proper test fixtures for sample images
- [ ] Create unit tests for each utility module
- [ ] Add integration tests for full pipeline

### **Priority 2: Code Quality**
- [ ] Run `black` and `isort` on all Python files
- [ ] Fix `flake8` linting issues
- [ ] Add type hints to main functions
- [ ] Add proper docstrings

### **Priority 3: Configuration Management**
- [ ] Refactor `config.py` to use environment variables
- [ ] Create separate configs for dev/test/prod
- [ ] Remove hardcoded paths

## üèóÔ∏è **FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS (Month 2)**

### **Advanced Features:**
- [ ] Add Docker containerization
- [ ] Create REST API with FastAPI
- [ ] Add database for processing history
- [ ] Implement async processing for large batches
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring

### **Documentation:**
- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Add usage examples and tutorials
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Add architecture documentation

## üìä **METRICS TO TRACK**

### **Code Quality Metrics:**
- Test coverage: Target 80%+
- Code complexity: Keep cyclomatic complexity < 10
- Documentation coverage: 100% for public APIs
- Security score: Zero high/critical vulnerabilities

### **Performance Metrics:**
- Processing time per image
- Memory usage during batch processing
- Success rate for different image formats
- Error rates and types

## üõ†Ô∏è **DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW**

### **New Feature Development:**
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement feature with proper logging
4. Run code quality checks: `make lint format test`
5. Commit with conventional commit messages
6. Create PR with comprehensive description
7. Squash and merge to develop

### **Code Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Tests pass: `pytest`
- [ ] Code formatted: `black src tests`
- [ ] Imports sorted: `isort src tests`
- [ ] Linting clean: `flake8 src tests`
- [ ] Type checking: `mypy src`
- [ ] Security check: `bandit -r src`

## üö® **COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS**

### **Issue 1: Tests Failing After Setup**
```bash
# Solution: Install missing dependencies
pip install rawpy  # For RAW image processing
pip install pytest-asyncio  # If using async code
```

### **Issue 2: Pre-commit Hooks Failing**
```bash
# Solution: Fix formatting then commit
black src tests
isort src tests
git add .
git commit -m "fix: format code with black and isort"
```

### **Issue 3: Import Errors in Tests**
```bash
# Solution: Add src to Python path
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:${PWD}/src"
# Or use pytest with proper path configuration
```

## üìà **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Development Quality:**
- ‚úÖ All tests pass consistently
- ‚úÖ Code coverage > 80%
- ‚úÖ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ‚úÖ CI/CD pipeline runs successfully

### **Maintainability:**
- ‚úÖ Clear documentation for all public APIs
- ‚úÖ Consistent code style across project
- ‚úÖ Easy setup for new developers
- ‚úÖ Modular, testable code structure

### **Collaboration:**
- ‚úÖ Multiple developers can work simultaneously
- ‚úÖ Clear git workflow and conventions
- ‚úÖ Automated quality checks prevent issues
- ‚úÖ Easy to review and merge contributions
