    print("   • Added brightness_adjustment() method to PhotoshopStyleEnhancer")
    print("   • Updated custom adjustments menu to include brightness option")

    print("   ├─ Exponential scaling (2^value)")

    print("   3. Enter 0 for exposure (skip it)")

    print("\n⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES:")

    print("   • If both are set, Exposure takes priority")
    print("   • Both methods use the same underlying ImageEnhance.Brightness")
